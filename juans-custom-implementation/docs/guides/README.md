# Practical guides

This section explains how to build, run, test, troubleshoot, and maintain the
project. Commands must state which directory they run from, their prerequisites,
and whether they apply to the full game or only a prototype.

## Available

- [Native Windows C++ build](NATIVE_WINDOWS_BUILD.md): installed MSVC toolchain,
  Conan setup, successful native policy tests, and full-build validation status.
- [OpenGL music setup](OPENGL_MUSIC.md): prepare the ALURE decoder filename without launching the game.
- [Vulkan bootstrap](VULKAN_BOOTSTRAP.md): standalone presentation build/run
  instructions and previously recorded verification. This does not build or run
  the complete game.

## To develop during the migration

- Complete game assets, configuration, build, and launch procedures.
- Reference-run and conversion-run setup, including independent writable state.
- Gameplay, graphics, persistence, and multiplayer testing procedures.
- Dependency/toolchain maintenance and troubleshooting instructions.

The [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md) defines when these procedures are needed. Unverified
commands and untested configurations must be identified rather than presented as
working instructions.
